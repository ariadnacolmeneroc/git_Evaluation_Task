# git_HandsOn
- Repository for practising with Hands_on.

- In this repository you can find both those commits made during the practice, as well as those belonging to the evaluation. Hence, all of them are indicated.

- In addition, I have contributed to the nucleotide_percent.py script which can be found in the repository: https://github.com/Carabian/git_HandsOn. First, the script was started via the Carabian repository and then changes were made and lines of code were added via ariadnacolmeneroc. So you will find this file in his repository with two contributors.
